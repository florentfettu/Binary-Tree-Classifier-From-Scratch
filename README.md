## Description
This aim of this project is to develop from scratch an algorithm in python without using any third party package, or as little as possible. 
 
## Scope of the project
* 3 hyperparameters were implemented (maximum depth, impurity criterion, minimum information gain)
* Better results than scikit-learn on the Iris dataset
